# Weather App

The assignment was to build a simple weather dashboard that uses a weather API to tell today's weather and temperature, as well as a 4-day forecast.

## The problem

I started out by creating a function to fetch the current weather, and converted the json object to be able to target specific data. Then went on to create the HTML foundation and updated the HTML with the weather data by using DOM-selectors. Thereafter I branched out to create more features like displaying times for sunrise and sunset, the 4-day forecast, doing CSS styling and add more icons than the provided set. I created new Date objects to format and compare dates, and used the Math method to round temperatures. Lastly I added a function to get the user's coordinates and make the app show the weather for that specific location.

If I had more time I would have implemented a searchbar so that the user can find the weather for different locations. Also add a section that shows weather or temp for every hour of the current day.
